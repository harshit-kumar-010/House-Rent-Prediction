# House Rent Prediction

## Overview

House Rent Prediction involves predicting the rent of a housing property based on various factors such as the number of bedrooms, size of the property, floor level, area type, locality, city, and furnishing status. 

This project aims to build a predictive model to estimate the rent of houses, apartments, or flats, helping tenants and landlords make informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information on over 4700 houses, apartments, or flats available for rent. It includes the following features:

- **BHK**: Number of bedrooms, hall, and kitchen
- **Rent**: Rent of the property
- **Size**: Size of the property in square feet
- **Floor**: Floor level and total number of floors
- **Area Type**: Type of area calculation (Super Area, Carpet Area, Build Area)
- **Area Locality**: Locality of the property
- **City**: City where the property is located
- **Furnishing Status:** Furnishing status of the property (Furnished, Semi-Furnished, Unfurnished)
- **Tenant Preferred:** Type of tenant preferred by the owner or agent
- **Bathroom**: Number of bathrooms
- **Point of Contact**: Contact information for more details

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the rent of a housing property based on its attributes. 
By leveraging the dataset, we aim to create a predictive model that can assist both tenants and landlords in estimating fair rent prices for properties.
